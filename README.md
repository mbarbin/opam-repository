# opam-repository

This repository is a package repository for the [opam package
manager](https://opam.ocaml.org).

To add it to the current opam switch, run:

```sh
opam repo add mbarbin https://github.com/mbarbin/opam-repository.git
```

The repo contains experimental packages that I do not intend to publish to the
main public opam repository. I also use this repo to learn more about opam.
