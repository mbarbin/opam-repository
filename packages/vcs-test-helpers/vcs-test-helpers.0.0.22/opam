description: """\

[volgo] is a set of OCaml libraries for interacting with Git
repositories. It provides a type-safe and direct-style API to
programmatically perform Git operations, ranging from creating
commits and branches to loading and navigating commit graphs in
memory, computing diffs between revisions, and more.

[Vcs_test_helpers] is a library aimed at making it easier to write
tests for libraries using [Vcs] as a dependency. For example, it
contains helpers for setting the running user's Git config, creating
temporary repositories, and more.
