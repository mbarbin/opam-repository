description: """\

[pplumbing] defines a set of utility libraries to use with [pp].
It is compatible with [logs] and inspired by design choices used
by [dune] for user messages.

These libraries are meant to combine nicely into a small ecosystem
of useful helpers to build CLIs in OCaml.

[pplumbing_pp_tty] extends [pp] to build colored documents in
the user's terminal using ansi escape codes.
