description: """\

Cmdlang is a library for creating command-line parsers in OCaml.
Implemented as an OCaml EDSL, its declarative specification language
lives at the intersection of other well-established similar libraries.

Cmdlang doesn't include an execution engine. Instead, Cmdlang parsers
are automatically translated to [cmdliner], [core.command], or
[climate] commands for execution.

[cmdliner]: https://github.com/dbuenzli/cmdliner
[climate]: https://github.com/gridbugs/climate
[core.command]: https://github.com/janestreet/core
